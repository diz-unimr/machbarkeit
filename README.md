# Machbarkeit App
An app for Nextcloud that allows researchers to perform local feasibility queries against a FHRI server. <br />
A feasibility request can be found out, how many data sets for your search criteria are available. <br />
The availability of health data for medical research purposes can be estimated using inclusion and exclusion criteria.

## Functionalities
- Attribute list define all attributes that will appear in the provided dataset
- Inclusion and exclusion criteria can be used to estimate the availability of health data for medical research purposes.
- Load queries
- Save queries

This is an example nextcloud app development setup.

This repository features a [Docker Compose setup](dev/compose.yaml) to develop against a specific Nextcloud version and supports
hot module replacement of the app's frontend (Vue.js) components.

## Building the app

1. Install php dependencies:
   ```
   make composer
   ```
2. Install npm dependencies:
   ```
   npm ci
   ```

## Run the app

1. Start the webpack dev server (see [package.json](package.json) from your development IDE:
   ```
   npm run serve
   ```
2. Start the Nextcloud Docker environment from the `dev` folder:
   ```
   docker compose up -d
   ```

This starts the [nextcloud-docker-dev](https://github.com/juliushaertl/nextcloud-docker-dev) container.

## Enable apps

In order for Hot module replacement (HMR) to work the [HMR Enabler](https://github.com/nextcloud/hmr_enabler) app
which is already mounted into the container needs to be enabled.

1. Login to `http://localhost:8080` with user `admin` and password `admin`.
2. Go to _Apps_ and **HMR Enabler** and the **Template App**

You can now go the App's navigation item at the top to see the example app from the
[Nextcloud App Generator](https://apps.nextcloud.com/developer/apps/generate).

Changes to the Vue.js frontend code should now trigger the webpack-dev-server to rebuild the code and the browser to
reload the content.
